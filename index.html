I am a senior researcher at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL), where I work in the AI R&D group studying reinforcement learning, foundation models, and robotics. I am interested in how general robotic control policies can be trained at scale, leveraging expert demonstrations and broader unlabeled datasets. Ultimately, I believe our most promising path towards general robotic agents lies in humanoid robotics, because it uses a common platform geometry, closes the gap between robotic systems and human demonstrations, and could leverage existing data about humans.
<br/>
<br/>
Recently there is some convergence in AI towards common architectures that are generally useful for many problem types, and these represent fundamental advancements that can quickly be brought to other disciplines (for example, Transformers in NLP can be brought into robotic control). I am currently teaching a course at the Johns Hopkins Engineering for Professionals program , ChatGPT from Scratch: Building and Training Large Language Models, which walks students through a ground-up construction of transformer models for text generation. This course will be offered again in Spring 2025.
<br/>
<br/>
Beyond work and teaching I try to maintain personal projects which may or may not overlap with my professional interests. Recently, I completed an free online word game called Word Towers. This fall (2024) I am planning to build a tabletop motion capture system to collect 3D demonstrations for training manipulation policies.

I also like to cook :)
